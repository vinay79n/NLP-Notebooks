catalog know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know obiwan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways

queen amidalas spaceship damaged efforts free federation meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn chalks force jinn feel skywalker great natural power force another subplot involving bet skywalker fantastic race enter details significance begin reveal also provides new explanation force never mentioned fact seems something important upsetting never mentioned element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary films third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot funny reality star
